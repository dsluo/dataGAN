## Disclaimer

I don't actually know how any of the neural network stuff works. I just made a GUI around what it was already doing.
Please don't ask me if some error comes up and it says something about a model. I probably won't be able to help you.
You can make an issue on this repository if you want, but no guarantees that it'll get answered.
